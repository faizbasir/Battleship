# Battleship

This is a code-based battleship game with the output within the IDE.

This project was originally created for a school project in an introductory course.

The game is a one-player game with a low-level difficulty for the AI. 

Future modifications to the project that will include a GUI and a higher level difficulty will be uploaded in due time in order to make improvements to this project.
